## 📋 Overview

This document contains additional numerical results that supplement those presented in the main research paper. These extended results provide insights into the performance and behavior of the proposed upper bounds.

## 📖 Table Structure Reference

### 📌 Column Definitions

The following column headers are shared across multiple tables and are defined here for reference:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **\|V\|** | Number of vertices in the graph |
| **% μ** | Percentage edge density of the graph |
| **#** | Number of instances sharing the same parameters |
| **% gap** | Percentage gap between bound and actual edge-weighted clique number |
| **% diff.** | Percentage difference between the two bounds |

<br>

The percentage difference between bounds is computed as:

$$\% \text{diff.} = 100 \cdot \frac{UB_1 - UB_2}{\max\{UB_1, \, UB_2\}}$$

## 🔄 Independent Set Ordering Sensitivity Analysis

The following tables present numerical results aimed at studying the variation of UB₂ values across different orderings of independent sets within the same coloring (specifically, obtained through DSATUR). 

The reported statistics analyze how the minimum and maximum bound values deviate from the average across these different orderings.

## 🎯 DIMACS Benchmark Analysis

The following table shows the percentage difference between the two upper bounds across DIMACS families, comparing results obtained with random edge weights versus those with deterministic edge weights. 

> **Note:** Since optimal solution values for EWMCP on instances with random edge weights are not available, gap-related statistics are omitted from this analysis.
