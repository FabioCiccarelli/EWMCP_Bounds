# Upper Bounds for the Edge-Weighted Maximum Clique Problem

This repository contains the implementation of two upper bounds for the Edge-Weighted Maximum Clique Problem (EWMCP), specifically the ones proposed by [San Segundo et al.](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejor.2019.03.047) and [Shimizu et al.](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.disopt.2020.100583). 

The code is associated with the research paper:

**"Strength of the Upper Bounds for the Edge-Weighted Maximum Clique Problem"**  
by F. Ciccarelli, V. Dose, F. Furini and M. Monaci.

## Acknowledgments

We would like to thank the contributors of [Brian Crites' graph-coloring repository](https://github.com/brrcrites/graph-coloring/tree/master) for the implementation of the DSATUR algorithm that we have included in our code.
